Optionally, openSMILE can be linked against the SEMAINE API 
and the Julius LVCSR engine, enabling an interface to the 
SEMAINE system and a keyword spotter component. 
See http://www.semaine-project.eu/ for details on running the 
SEMAINE system.
Only the older versions of openSMILE (1.0.1) are officially 
supported to be built with the SEMAINE system.
For recent developments, check out the status of the ARIA VALUSPA
EU-project: http://aria-agent.eu/
